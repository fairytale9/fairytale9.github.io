Hello, I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Boston University majoring in Systems Engneering with Operations Research concentration. Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in physics at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I am fortunately working with Prof. [Aldo Pacchiano](https://www.aldopacchiano.ai) and Prof. [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/) on reinforcement learning. My research interest lies in studying and devising foundational models and algorithms for decision-making problems.
